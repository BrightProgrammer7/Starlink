(00:00) Beaming internet from the middle of theÂ  woods using an extra-large pizza-sized satellite dish placed on top of your house upÂ  to a satellite orbiting 550 kilometers outside Earthâ€™s atmosphere, well letâ€™s be honest, isÂ  technologically mind-blowing. Whatâ€™s even crazier is that the Starlink satellites move incrediblyÂ  fast, around 27,000 kilometers per hour, and data is being sent back and forth between themÂ  at hundreds of megabits per second, all while the dish and satellite are continuously anglingÂ  or steering the beam of data pointed directly
(00:38) between them. On top of that, the dish switchesÂ  between different satellites every 4 or so minutes because they move out of the dishesâ€™ field ofÂ  view rather quickly. If you have no clue as to how this is possible, stick around because weâ€™reÂ  going to dive into the multiple key technologies which enable satellite internet to magically work.
(01:03) First, weâ€™ll explore inside the satellite dish and see how it generates a beam of data that is ableÂ  to reach space. Second, weâ€™ll see how this dish continuously steers the beam so that it pointsÂ  directly at a satellite moving across the sky. And third, weâ€™ll dive into what exactly the dish andÂ  satellite are sending inside the beam that results in your ability to stream five HD movies or showsÂ  simultaneously.
(01:30) This video is quite long as itâ€™s full of in-depth details. We recommend watchingÂ  it first at one point two five times speed, and then a second time at one and a half speedÂ  to understand it as a complete technology. So, stick around, and letâ€™s jump right in. First, letâ€™s start by clarifying the difference between a television satellite dishÂ  such as this one, and the Starlink ground dish, which Elon Musk dubbed Dishy McFlatface or DishyÂ  for short.
(02:03) TV dishes use a parabolic reflector to focus the electromagnetic waves which areÂ  the TV signals sent from broadcast satellites orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 35 thousandÂ  kilometers. TV satellite dishes only receive TV signals from space, they canâ€™t send data. Dishy, however, both sends and receives internet data from a Starlink satellite orbiting 550Â  kilometers away.
(02:29) While the Starlink satellite is 60 times closer than TV satellites, itâ€™s still anÂ  incredible distance to wirelessly send a signal, and thus the beams between Dishy and the StarlinkÂ  satellite need to be focused into tight powerful beams that are continuously angled or steered toÂ  point at one another. Compare this to TV broadcast signals which come from a satellite the size ofÂ  a van, and whose signals propagate in a wide fan that covers land masses larger than NorthÂ  America.
(03:01) Table size Starlink satellites, however, need to be in a low earth orbitÂ  to provide for 20-millisecond latencies, which is critical for smoothly playing internetÂ  games or surfing the web, and as a result, their coverage is much smaller. Thus 10,000 or moreÂ  Starlink satellites, all orbiting at incredibly fast speeds in a low earth orbit, are required toÂ  provide satellite internet to the entire earth.
(03:28) Letâ€™s now open up Dishy McFlatface. At the back,Â  we have a pair of motors and an ethernet cable that connects to the router. Note that theseÂ  motors donâ€™t continuously move Dishy to point directly at the Starlink satellite; theyâ€™re usedÂ  only for initial setup to get the dish pointed in the proper general direction.
(03:52) Opening up Dishy,Â  we find an aluminum structural back-plate and on the other side, we find a massive printed circuitÂ  board or PCB. One side has 640 small microchips and 20 larger microchips organized inÂ  a pattern with very intricate traces fanning out from the larger to smaller microchips,Â  along with additional chips including the main CPU and GPS module on the edge of the PCB.
(04:20) On theÂ  other side are 1,400ish copper circles with a grid of squares between the circles. On the next layer,Â  thereâ€™s a rubber honeycomb pattern with small, notched cop-per circles, and behind that, we findÂ  another honeycomb pattern and then the front side of Dishy. So, what are we looking at? Well, inÂ  essence, we have 1280 antennas arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb pattern, with each stack ofÂ  copper circles being a single antenna controlled by the microchips on the PCB.
(04:53) This massive arrayÂ  works together in whatâ€™s called a phased array in order to send and receive electromagneticÂ  waves that are angled to and from a Starlink satellite orbiting 550 kilometers above. Letâ€™sÂ  zoom in and see how a single antenna operates. Here we have an aperture coupled patch antennaÂ  composed of 6 layers, most of which are inside the PCB.
(05:20) It looks very different from theÂ  antenna of an old-school radio, and is honestly, incredibly complicated, so letâ€™s simplifyÂ  it. Weâ€™ll remove a few of the layers for now, and step through the basic principles ofÂ  how we generate an electromagnetic wave that propagates out from this antenna. To start, at the bottom we have a microstrip transmission line feed coming from one of theÂ  small microchips.
(05:43) This transmission line feed is just a copper PCB trace or wire that abruptly endsÂ  under the antenna stack. We send a 12 Gigahertz high-frequency voltage or signal to the feedÂ  wire which is a voltage that goes up and down in a sinusoidal fashion, going from positiveÂ  to negative and back to positive once every 83 pico-seconds, 12 billion times a second, or 12Â  Gigahertz.
(06:11) Note that high-frequency electricity works differently from direct current or lowÂ  frequency 50 or 60-hertz household electricity. For example, above the copper feed wire, weÂ  have a copper circle with notches cut into it called an antenna patch. With DC orÂ  low-frequency alternating current, there wouldnâ€™t be much happening because the patchÂ  is isolated, but with a high-frequency signal, the power sent to the feed wire is coupled or sentÂ  to the patch.
(06:42) How exactly does this happen? Well, as mentioned earlier, a 12 Gigahertz signal isÂ  applied to the copper feed wire. When the voltage is at the bottom of its sinusoidal, or trough,Â  we have a concentration of electrons pushed to the end of the feed wire thus creating a zone ofÂ  negative charge which corresponds to the maximum negative voltage.
(07:08) This concentration of electronsÂ  on the tip of the wire repels all electrons away, including the electrons on the top of the patch,Â  and as a result, these electrons are pushed to the other side of the circular patch. Thus, oneÂ  side of the patch becomes positively charged, while the other becomes negativelyÂ  charged, thereby creating electric fields between the patch and feed wire like so.
(07:31) However, when we reverse the voltage to the copper feed wire 42 picoseconds later, we have aÂ  concentration of positive charges, or a lack of electrons at the end of the wire, and thus theÂ  electrons in the patch flow to the other side, the voltage in the patch is flipped, and theÂ  direction of the electric fields are also flipped. Because the feed wire voltage oscillates back andÂ  forth, 42 picoseconds between one peak and trough, the electric fields in the patch will alsoÂ  oscillate as the electrons, or current, flows back and forth. If we pause the oscillation
(08:05) we can see some of these electric field vectors,Â  or arrows, from the patch, are vertical, and because they are equal and opposite, they cancelÂ  out. However, other electric fields are horizontal in the same plane of the patch and are calledÂ  fringing fields. These fringing fields are in the same direction and thus they add to each other,Â  resulting in a combined electric field pointing in this direction.
(08:35) At the same time, electronsÂ  flowing from one side of the disk to the other, which is an electric current, generate aÂ  magnetic field with a strength and direction, or vector, perpendicular to the fringingÂ  electric field vector. As a result, we have an electric field pointing one way, andÂ  a magnetic field pointing perpendicular to that. Letâ€™s move forward in time to where theÂ  voltage on the feedline becomes positive, and now, weâ€™re at the peak of the sinusoid, 42Â  picoseconds later.
(09:03) The charge concentrations, or voltage, as well as the current, is allÂ  flipped, and thus the electric and magnetic fields point in the opposite directions. ElectricÂ  and magnetic fields propagate in all directions, and by creating these oscillating fields,Â  weâ€™ve generated an electromagnetic wave which travels in the direction perpendicular toÂ  both the electric and magnetic field vectors.
(09:27) Because the two sets of field vectors are notÂ  all in the same plane, but rather are curved, the propagating electromagnetic wave travels outwardsÂ  in an expanding shell or balloon-like fashion, kind of like a light bulb on the ceiling. Letâ€™sÂ  simplify the visual so we only see the peak and trough or top and bottom of each wave and noteÂ  that the trough is just a vector pointed in the opposite direction.
(09:59) Additionally, the strengthsÂ  of these field vectors directly relate back to the voltage and signal that we originally sentÂ  to the copper microstrip feed wire at the bottom of the stack. Which means, if we want to makeÂ  these electric and magnetic fields stronger, we just have to increase the voltage sent to theÂ  feedline. Itâ€™s like a dimmer on a light switch: more power equals a brighter light.
(10:21) Thus far weâ€™ve been talking about this aperture-coupled patch-antenna as transmitting;Â  however, it can also be used for receiving a signal. In this microchip, called a front-endÂ  module, we switch the antenna from transmit to receive and turn off the 12 Gigahertz signal.Â  When an electromagnetic wave from the satellite is directed towards Dishy, the electric fieldsÂ  from this incoming signal will influence the electrons in the copper patch, thus generatingÂ  an oscillating flow of electrons.
(10:51) This received high-frequency signal is then coupled to theÂ  feedline where itâ€™s sent to the front-end module chip which amplifies the signal. Thus, theseÂ  antennas can be used to both transmit and receive electromagnetic waves, but, not at the same time. Two quick things to note. First, as seen earlier, this antenna has many more layers and is moreÂ  complicated than weâ€™ve discussed.
(11:17) For example, here are two circular patches. The bottom isÂ  used to transmit at 13 Gigahertz while the top to receive at 11.7 Gigahertz. Additionally,Â  there are two H slots and two feed wires to support circular polarization, a reflective planeÂ  in the back, and also, there are multiple features for isolating the operation of one antenna fromÂ  the adjacent antennas.
(11:42) Weâ€™ve included these and many more details in the creatorâ€™s comments whichÂ  you can find in the English Canadian subtitles. The second note is that there are electromagneticÂ  waves of all different frequencies from thousands of different sources passing throughÂ  every point on Earth, whether it be visible light from the sun, radio waves from radio orÂ  cell towers, or TV signals from satellites or towers.
(12:11) Therefore in order to block out allÂ  other frequencies of electromagnetic waves, these antenna patches are designed withÂ  very exact dimensions so that they receive and transmit only a very narrow range ofÂ  frequencies, and all the other frequencies outside this range are essentially ignoredÂ  by the antenna. Letâ€™s move on and see how a single antenna can be combined with others inÂ  order to amplify the beam to reach outer space.
(12:33) This single antenna is only a centimeter orÂ  so in diameter and using only it would be like turning on and off one light bulb and tryingÂ  to see it from the international space station. What we need is a way to make the light a fewÂ  thousand times brighter, and then focus all the electromagnetic waves into a single powerfulÂ  beam. Enter the massive Mr.
(12:59) McFlatface PCB, 55 centimeters wide with a total of 1280Â  identical antennas in a hexagonal array. The technique of combining all the antennasâ€™Â  power together is called beamforming. So how does it work? Well, letâ€™s first see whatÂ  happens when we have two simplified antennas spaced a short distance away.
(13:25) As mentioned before,Â  one antenna generates an electromagnetic wave that propagates outwards in a balloon shape. At everyÂ  single point in space, thereâ€™s only one electric field vector with a strength and direction andÂ  thus the two antennasâ€™ oscillating electric field vectors combine together at all points inÂ  space. In some areas, the electric fields from the antennas are pointing in the same directionÂ  with overlapping peaks, and thus add together via constructive interference, and in other locations,Â  theyâ€™re oppo-site with one peak and one trough, and thus they cancel each other via destructiveÂ  interference. We can now see that the zone where
(14:02) they add together constructively is far tighter,Â  or more focused, than a single antenna alone. When we add even more antennas, the zone ofÂ  constructive interference becomes even more focused in what is called a beam front.Â  Thus, by adding 1280 antennas together we can form a beam with so much intensity andÂ  directionality that it can reach outer space.
(14:27) Now you might be thinking that the strength of 1Â  antenna duplicated 1280 times over would result in a combined power of, well, 1280 times a singleÂ  antenna, but youâ€™d be mistaken. The effective power and range of the main beam from all theseÂ  antennas combined is actually closer to 3500 times that of a single antenna.
(14:55) The quick explanationÂ  is that by having these patterns of constructive and destructive interference, itâ€™s as if weÂ  took a single antenna, multiplied it by 1280, and then placed a whole bunch of mirrors aroundÂ  it and left only a single hole for the main beam to exit through. The long explanation requiresÂ  a ton of math and physics, so letâ€™s move on. Dishy McFlatface and the Starlink SatellitesÂ  undoubtedly have some rather complicated science and engineering inside and to fully comprehend itÂ  all you have to be a multidisciplinary student.

Now letâ€™s continue exploring how a powerfulÂ  beam can be continuously swept across the sky, and then how we fill it with hundredsÂ  of megabits of data every second.
(17:02) As a quick refresher from before, hereâ€™sÂ  an array of 1280 antennas and we fed them all with the same 12 Gigahertz signal in order toÂ  create a laser-like beam propagating perpendicular to Dishy. However, as mentioned earlier, we needÂ  to be able to angle this beam so that it points directly at the Starlink satellite zoomingÂ  across the sky at 27,000 kilometers per hour.
(17:26) Using the motors isnâ€™t feasible because they wouldÂ  break within a month and arenâ€™t accurate enough. So, the solution is to use whatâ€™sÂ  called phased array beam steering. Letâ€™s go back to our two-antennaÂ  example. Before we were feeding the same signal to the two antennas, and thusÂ  the antennas were in phase with one another.
(17:47) Understanding phase is critical, so quickly:Â  changing the height or amplitude of the signal is done by changing the power sent to theÂ  antenna, thus making the signal stronger or weaker. The frequency is how many peaks andÂ  troughs, or wavelengths there are in one second, and changing the phase is shifting the signal leftÂ  or right.
(18:12) Phase shifting is measured in degrees between 0 and 359, because, if we shift the signalÂ  360 degrees, or one full wavelength, then weâ€™re back at the beginning, exactly as if we were toÂ  loop around a circle. For example, hereâ€™s a signal with a 45-degree phase shift, hereâ€™s anotherÂ  with a 180-degree shift, and then another with a 315-degree shift.
(18:41) Your eyes canâ€™t see differencesÂ  in phase shifted visible light, however, high-tech circuitry such as whatâ€™s inside Dishy is reallyÂ  good at detecting and working with phase shifts. So then, how do we use phase shifting to angle theÂ  beam and have it point directly at the satellite? The solution is to phase shift the signal sent toÂ  one antenna with respect to the other antenna and, as a result, the timing of the peaks and troughsÂ  emitted from one antenna is different from the other.
(19:10) These peaks and troughs propagateÂ  outwards, and the location of the constructive interference is now angled to the left withÂ  destructive interference everywhere else. If we change the phase of the antennas again, theÂ  zone of constructive interference is angled to the right. Therefore, by continuously changingÂ  the phase of the signals sent to the antennas, we can create a sweeping zone ofÂ  the constructive interference.
(19:31) Let's bring in six more antennas and simplifyÂ  the visual so that we only see a section of the peaks from each wave. Far away from theÂ  antennas, the waves join to form a wave front that is a planar wave. Kind of like oceanÂ  waves crashing on a shoreline. Just as before, by continuously changing the timing of whenÂ  each wave peak is emitted by each antenna, we can change the angle at which the wave frontÂ  is formed, essentially steering the beam in one direction or another. And, if we bring inÂ  more antennas in a two-dimensional array,
(20:08) we can now steer the beam in any directionÂ  within a one-hundred-degree field of view. Letâ€™s move back to view all 1280 antennas inÂ  Dishy. In order to know the exact angle the beam needs to be pointed or steered, we use the GPSÂ  coordinates of Dishy from this chip over here, along with the orbital position of the StarlinkÂ  satellite which is known in Dishyâ€™s software.
(20:32) The software computes the exact set of 3D angles andÂ  the required phase shift for each of the antennas. These phase shift results are then sentÂ  to the 20 larger chips called beamformers, and each beamformer coordinates between 32 smallerÂ  chips called front end modules, each of which controls 2 antennas.
(20:59) Every few microseconds, theseÂ  computations are recalculated and disseminated to all the microchips in order to perfectly aim theÂ  beam at the satellite. As a result, the beam can be steered anywhere in a 100-degree field of view. There are a few quick notes. First, the main beam, also called the main lobe looks like this.Â  However, constructive and destructive interference isnâ€™t perfect, and as a resultÂ  there are additional side lobes of lesser power.
(21:24) Third, Mr. McFlatface holds is a single phasedÂ  array, however, on the Starlink satellite, there are in fact 4 phased array antennas. TwoÂ  are used to communicate with multiple Dishys, and 2 are used to communicate with the groundÂ  stations to relay the internet traffic. And fourth, phased arrays are used in manyÂ  applications, and interestingly theyâ€™re used on commercial airlines to allow for mid-flightÂ  internet.
(21:54) So this video also tangentially explains how mid-flight internet works. Before we explore how actual data is sent, we want to mention that this video took a monthÂ  to research, two dozen script revisions, and two months to model and animate. If your mind is blownÂ  by the complexity of this technology and the depth of this video click the subscribe button, likeÂ  this video, write a comment below, and weâ€™ll be sure to create more videos like this one.
(22:26) The third topic weâ€™re going to dive into is how information gets sent between Dishy andÂ  the Starlink satellite. For example, weâ€™ve talked about high-frequencyÂ  sinusoid-shaped electromagnetic waves, but that doesnâ€™t look anything like binaryÂ  and even less like your favorite TV show. So, whatâ€™s happening? Well, Dishy and theÂ  satellite indeed send a signal that looks like this; however, they vary the amplitude and theÂ  phase of the transmitted signal and then assign or encode 6-bit binary values to each differentÂ  combination or permutation of amplitude and phase.
(23:01) With 6 bits, there are 64 differentÂ  values, and thus we need 64 different permutations of amplitude and phase. However,Â  instead of listing all the permutations, itâ€™s more easily visualized by arranging the 64Â  different values in a graph called a constellation diagram as shown. Letâ€™s look at the point 011 101Â  and draw a line from the origin to this point.
(23:28) The distance from the origin is the amplitudeÂ  of the signal, and the angle from the positive-X axis is the phase. Itâ€™s a bit like using polarÂ  coordinates. Thus, for Dishy to send these 6-bits, it transmits a signal with an amplitudeÂ  of 59% and a phase shift of 121 degrees. Then, if the next value being sent is 101 000, theÂ  signal switches to an 87% amplitude or brightness, and a 305-degree phase shift.
(24:06) After that it sendsÂ  the next value with a different amplitude and phase shift. Each of these 6-bit groupings areÂ  called symbols and they last for only 10 or so nanoseconds before the next symbol is sent. Lots of times you see the signal scrunched up like this however, because the frequency ofÂ  the signal is just once every 83 picoseconds, or 12 Gigahertz, and since a symbol lasts 10Â  nanoseconds, itâ€™s more accurate to have around 120 wavelengths per symbol before the next symbolÂ  is sent.
(24:38) Because weâ€™re dealing on the order of pico and nanoseconds, that means that weÂ  can fit 90 million 6-bit groups or symbols, resulting in 540 million bits per second. However,Â  note that this data transfer is shared between download and upload. Since this particular antennaÂ  canâ€™t transmit and receive data at the same time, about 74 milliseconds of every second isÂ  used to send data from Dishy to the Starlink satellite and 926 milliseconds is used to sendÂ  data from the satellite down to Dishy.
(25:12) And, for the sake of reducing latency, these timeÂ  slots get distributed throughout a single second instead of grouping them all together. This technique of sending 6-bit values using different variations of amplitude andÂ  phase is called 64QAM or Quadrature Amplitude Modulation and is more complicated than weÂ  discussed but letâ€™s not get sidetracked.
(25:37) Now that we have a stream of millions of 6-bitÂ  symbols yielding hundreds of megabits of data per second, in order to turn it into your favoriteÂ  TV show we use the advanced video codec, or h.264 format. You can learn more about that in ourÂ  video that explores image compression shown here. Iâ€™m sure you have many questions, and byÂ  all means put them in the comments below, but before we finish letâ€™s clarify two things.
(26:11) First, the scale of practically everything in this video is off. Hereâ€™s the correct scale of DishyÂ  and the Starlink Satellite, however Dishy is 550 kilometers away which we canâ€™t correctly show. InÂ  stark contrast, the emitted electromagnetic waves are only around 2.5 centimeters apart, and thusÂ  between Dishy and the satellite there are around 22 million wavelengths which is many more than theÂ  few waves that you see here.
(26:42) Additionally, in this animation weâ€™re showing the wavelengths slowlyÂ  making their way up and down, when in reality it only takes around 2 milliseconds for anÂ  electromagnetic wave emitted from Dishy or the Starlink satellite to reach the other. The second clarification is that we disproportionately show Dishy emittingÂ  electromagnetic waves and sending them to the satellite.
(27:10) In reality the satellite dishÂ  is more frequently in receive mode and the steps and physics of receiving an electromagnetic waveÂ  are similar to emitting one, just in reverse. Thatâ€™s pretty much it for how Starlink and DishyÂ  send data to each other. The original script for this video was over 45 minutes long, so all theÂ  details that were cut got thrown in the creatorâ€™s comments found in the English Canada subtitles.
