Transcript: "Beaming internet from the middle of theÂ  woods using an extra-large pizza-sized satellite dish placed on top of your house upÂ  to a satellite orbiting 550 kilometers outside Earthâ€™s atmosphere, well letâ€™s be honest, isÂ  technologically mind-blowing. Whatâ€™s even crazier is that the Starlink satellites move incrediblyÂ  fast, around 27,000 kilometers per hour, and data is being sent back and forth between themÂ  at hundreds of megabits per second, all while the dish and satellite are continuously an glingÂ  or steering the beam of data pointed directly between them. On top of that, the dish switchesÂ  between different satellites every 4 or so minutes because they move out of the dishesâ€™ field ofÂ  view rather quickly. If you have no clue as to how this is possible, stick around because weâ€™reÂ  going to dive into the multiple key technologies which enable satellite internet to magically work. First, weâ€™ll explore inside the satellite dish and see how it generates a beam of data that is ableÂ  to reach space. Second, weâ€™ll see how this dish continuously steers the beam so that it pointsÂ  directly at a satellite moving across the sky. And third, weâ€™ll dive into what exactly the dish andÂ  satellite are sending inside the beam that results in your ability to stream five HD movies or showsÂ  simultaneously. This video is quite long as itâ€™s full of in-depth details. We recommend watchingÂ  it first at one point two five times speed, and then a second time at one and a half speedÂ  to understand it as a complete technology. So, stick around, and letâ€™s jump right in. First, letâ€™s start by clarifying the difference between a television satellite dishÂ  such as this one, and the Starlink ground dish, which Elon Musk dubbed Dishy McFlatface or DishyÂ  for short. TV dishes use a parabolic reflector to focus the electromagnetic waves which areÂ  the TV signals sent from broadcast satellites orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 35 thousandÂ  kilometers. TV satellite dishes only receive TV signals from space, they canâ€™t send data. Dishy, however, both sends and receives internet data from a Starlink satellite orbiting 550Â  kilometers away. While the Starlink satellite is 60 times closer than TV satellites, itâ€™s still anÂ  incredible distance to wirelessly send a signal, and thus the beams between Dishy and the StarlinkÂ  satellite need to be focused into tight powerful beams that are continuously angled or steered toÂ  point at one another. Compare this to TV broadcast signals which come fr om a satellite the size ofÂ  a van, and whose signals propagate in a wide fan that covers land masses larger than NorthÂ  America. Table size Starlink satellites, however, need to be in a low earth orbitÂ  to provide for 20-millisecond latencies, which is critical for smoothly playing internetÂ  games or surfing the web, and as a result, their coverage is much smaller. Thus 10,000 or moreÂ  Starlink satellites, all orbiting at incredibly fast speeds in a low earth orbit, are required toÂ  provide sate llite internet to the entire earth. Letâ€™s now open up Dishy McFlatface. At the back,Â  we have a pair of motors and an ethernet cable that connects to the router. Note that theseÂ  motors donâ€™t continuously move Dishy to point directly at the Starlink satellite; theyâ€™re usedÂ  only for initial setup to get the dish pointed in the proper general direction. Opening up Dishy,Â  we find an aluminum structural back-plate and on the other side, we find a massive printed circuitÂ  board or PCB. One side has f Dishy. So, what are we looking at? Well, inÂ  essence, we have 1280 antennas arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb pattern, with each stack ofÂ  copper circles being a single antenna controlled by the microchips on the PCB. This massive arrayÂ  works together in whatâ€™s called a phased array in order to send and receive electromagneticÂ  waves that are angled to and from a Starlink satellite orbiting 550 kilometers above. Letâ€™sÂ  zoom in and see how a single antenna operates. Here we have an aperture co ne feed is just a copper PCB trace or wire that abruptly endsÂ  under the antenna stack. We send a 12 Gigahertz high-frequency voltage or signal to the feedÂ  wire which is a voltage that goes up and down in a sinusoidal fashion, going from positiveÂ  to negative and back to positive once every 83 pico-seconds, 12 billion times a second, or 12Â  Gigahertz. Note that high-frequency electricity works differently from direct current or lowÂ  frequency 50 or 60-hertz household electricity. For example, a ave a concentration of electrons pushed to the end of the feed wire thus creating a zone ofÂ  negative charge which corresponds to the maximum negative voltage. This concentration of electronsÂ  on the tip of the wire repels all electrons away, including the electrons on the top of the patch,Â  and as a result, these electrons are pushed to the other side of the circular patch. Thus, oneÂ  side of the patch becomes positively charged, while the other becomes negativelyÂ  charged, thereby creating ele ic fields in the patch will alsoÂ  oscillate as the electrons, or current, flows back and forth. If we pause the oscillation we can see some of these electric field vectors,Â  or arrows, from the patch, are vertical, and because they are equal and opposite, they cancelÂ  out. However, other electric fields are horizontal in the same plane of the patch and are calledÂ  fringing fields. These fringing fields are in the same direction and thus they add to each other,Â  resulting in a combined electric f 42Â  picoseconds later. The charge concentrations, or voltage, as well as the current, is allÂ  flipped, and thus the electric and magnetic fields point in the opposite directions. ElectricÂ  and magnetic fields propagate in all directions, and by creating these oscillating fields,Â  weâ€™ve generated an electromagnetic wave which travels in the direction perpendicular toÂ  both the electric and magnetic field vectors. Because the two sets of field vectors are notÂ  all in the same plane, but rather ar the stack. Which means, if we want to makeÂ  these electric and magnetic fields stronger, we just have to increase the voltage sent to theÂ  feedline. Itâ€™s like a dimmer on a light switch: more power equals a brighter light. Thus far weâ€™ve been talking about this aperture-coupled patch-antenna as transmitting;Â  however, it can also be used for receiving a signal. In this microchip, called a front-endÂ  module, we switch the antenna from transmit to receive and turn off the 12 Gigahertz signal.Â  Wh . First, as seen earlier, this antenna has many more layers and is moreÂ  complicated than weâ€™ve discussed. For example, here are two circular patches. The bottom isÂ  used to transmit at 13 Gigahertz while the top to receive at 11.7 Gigahertz. Additionally,Â  there are two H slots and two feed wires to support circular polarization, a reflective planeÂ  in the back, and also, there are multiple features for isolating the operation of one antenna fromÂ  the adjacent antennas. Weâ€™ve included these and withÂ  very exact dimensions so that they receive and transmit only a very narrow range ofÂ  frequencies, and all the other frequencies outside this range are essentially ignoredÂ  by the antenna. Letâ€™s move on and see how a single antenna can be combined with others inÂ  order to amplify the beam to reach outer space. This single antenna is only a centimeter orÂ  so in diameter and using only it would be like turning on and off one light bulb and tryingÂ  to see it from the international space statio one antenna generates an electromagnetic wave that propagates outwards in a balloon shape. At everyÂ  single point in space, thereâ€™s only one electric field vector with a strength and direction andÂ  thus the two antennasâ€™ oscillating electric field vectors combine together at all points inÂ  space. In some areas, the electric fields from the antennas are pointing in the same directionÂ  with overlapping peaks, and thus add together via constructive interference, and in other locations,Â  theyâ€™re op u might be thinking that the strength of 1Â  antenna duplicated 1280 times over would result in a combined power of, well, 1280 times a singleÂ  antenna, but youâ€™d be mistaken. The effective power and range of the main beam from all theseÂ  antennas combined is actually closer to 3500 times that of a single antenna. The quick explanationÂ  is that by having these patterns of constructive and destructive interference, itâ€™s as if weÂ  took a single antenna, multiplied it by 1280, and then placed a whol angeÂ  of STEM topics in hands-on, interactive ways, many of which directly relate to StarlinkÂ  and other cutting-edge technologies such as electric cars, quantum computers,Â  rocketry, or neural networks. For example, they have an entire course dedicatedÂ  to Waves and Light, and another one on gravitational physics which will greatly helpÂ  in understanding Starlink and SpaceX rockets. Brilliant is nothing like a boring textbook,Â  but rather all the courses use interactive modules to make the less scription to the first 200 people who sign up. Just go to brilliant.org/brancheducation.Â  You can find that link in the description below. Now letâ€™s continue exploring how a powerfulÂ  beam can be continuously swept across the sky, and then how we fill it with hundredsÂ  of megabits of data every second. As a quick refresher from before, hereâ€™sÂ  an array of 1280 antennas and we fed them all with the same 12 Gigahertz signal in order toÂ  create a laser-like beam propagating perpendicular to Dishy. other. Understanding phase is critical, so quickly:Â  changing the height or amplitude of the signal is done by changing the power sent to theÂ  antenna, thus making the signal stronger or weaker. The frequency is how many peaks andÂ  troughs, or wavelengths there are in one second, and changing the phase is shifting the signal leftÂ  or right. Phase shifting is measured in degrees between 0 and 359, because, if we shift the signalÂ  360 degrees, or one full wavelength, then weâ€™re back at the beginni se shift the signal sent toÂ  one antenna with respect to the other antenna and, as a result, the timing of the peaks and troughsÂ  emitted from one antenna is different from the other. These peaks and troughs propagate outwards, and the location of the constructive interference is now angled to the left withÂ  destructive interference everywhere else. If we change the phase of the antennas again, theÂ  zone of constructive interference is angled to the right. Therefore, by continuously changingÂ  t ich the wave frontÂ  is formed, essentially steering the beam in one direction or another. And, if we bring inÂ  more antennas in a two-dimensional array, we can now steer the beam in any directionÂ  within a one-hundred-degree field of view. Letâ€™s move back to view all 1280 antennas inÂ  Dishy. In order to know the exact angle the beam needs to be pointed or steered, we use the GPSÂ  coordinates of Dishy from this chip over here, along with the orbital position of the StarlinkÂ  satellite which is kn the beam can be steered anywhere in a 100-degree field of view. There are a few quick notes. First, the main beam, also called the main lobe looks like this.Â  However, constructive and destructive interference isnâ€™t perfect, and as a resultÂ  there are additional side lobes of lesser power. Third, Mr. McFlatface holds is a single phasedÂ  array, however, on the Starlink satellite, there are in fact 4 phased array antennas. TwoÂ  are used to communicate with multiple Dishys, and 2 are used to commun technology and the depth of this video click the subscribe button, likeÂ  this video, write a comment below, and weâ€™ll be sure to create more videos like this one. The third topic weâ€™re going to dive into is how information gets sent between Dishy andÂ  the Starlink satellite. For example, weâ€™ve talked about high-frequencyÂ  sinusoid-shaped electromagnetic waves, but that doesnâ€™t look anything like binaryÂ  and even less like your favorite TV show. So, whatâ€™s happening? Well, Dishy and theÂ  satelli iagram as shown. Letâ€™s look at the point 011 101Â  and draw a line from the origin to this point. The distance from the origin is the amplitudeÂ  of the signal, and the angle from the positive-X axis is the phase. Itâ€™s a bit like using polarÂ  coordinates. 
Thus, for Dishy to send these 6-bits, it transmits a signal with an amplitudeÂ  of 59% and a phase shift of 121 degrees. Then, if the next value being sent is 101 000, theÂ  signal switches to an 87% amplitude or brightness, and a 305-degree phase t. Because weâ€™re dealing on the order of pico and nanoseconds, that means that weÂ  can fit 90 million 6-bit groups or symbols, resulting in 540 million bits per second. However,Â  note that this data transfer is shared between download and upload. Since this particular antennaÂ  canâ€™t transmit and receive data at the same time, about 74 milliseconds of every second isÂ  used to send data from Dishy to the Starlink satellite and 926 milliseconds is used to sendÂ  data from the satellite down to Dishy TV show we use the advanced video codec, or h.264 format. You can learn more about that in ourÂ  video that explores image compression shown here. Iâ€™m sure you have many questions, and byÂ  all means put them in the comments below, but before we finish letâ€™s clarify two things. 
First, the scale of practically everything in this video is off. Hereâ€™s the correct scale of DishyÂ  and the Starlink Satellite, however Dishy is 550 kilometers away which we canâ€™t correctly show. InÂ  stark contrast, the e ionately show Dishy emittingÂ  electromagnetic waves and sending them to the satellite. In reality the satellite dishÂ  is more frequently in receive mode and the steps and physics of receiving an electromagnetic waveÂ  are similar to emitting on"
